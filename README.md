# Task 4 â€“ Firewall Configuration with UFW

This task demonstrates basic firewall configuration on a Kali Linux VM using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**.

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Check UFW status (before enabling)
`sudo ufw status numbered`

Output:

`Status: inactive`

### 2. Enable UFW
`sudo ufw enable`

Output:

`Firewall is active and enabled on system startup`

### 3. Verify status (after enabling)
`sudo ufw status numbered`

Output:

`Status: active`


### 4. Allow SSH (Port 22)
`sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`

Output:

`Rule added
Rule added (v6)`


### 5. Deny Telnet (Port 23)
`sudo ufw deny 23/tcp`

Output:

`Rule added
Rule added (v6)`


### 6. Test Telnet blocking with Netcat
`nc -vz 127.0.0.1 23`

Output:

`nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 23 (tcp) failed: Connection refused`


### 7. View firewall rules
`sudo ufw status numbered`

Output:

`[ 1] 22/tcp   ALLOW IN  Anywhere
[ 2] 23/tcp   DENY IN   Anywhere
[ 3] 22/tcp   ALLOW IN  Anywhere (v6)
[ 4] 23/tcp   DENY IN   Anywhere (v6)`


### 8. Remove the Telnet block rule
`sudo ufw delete 2`
`sudo ufw delete 3`


### 9. Final firewall rules
`sudo ufw status numbered`

Output:

`[ 1] 22/tcp   ALLOW IN  Anywhere
[ 2] 22/tcp   ALLOW IN  Anywhere (v6)`


## Summary

Enabled UFW firewall on Kali Linux.

Allowed SSH (22/tcp) to ensure remote access.

Denied Telnet (23/tcp) and verified with Netcat that connections were blocked.

Removed the Telnet block rule successfully.

This demonstrates the ability to configure, test, and manage firewall rules with UFW.

## How Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall filters traffic by applying rules that determine whether to allow or block network packets based on specific criteria such as:

* IP addresses (source or destination)

* Ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 23 for Telnet)

* Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

* Direction (incoming or outgoing traffic)

When a packet reaches the system:

1. The firewall checks it against the configured rules in order.

2. If the packet matches a rule, the action (ALLOW or DENY) is applied.

3. If no rule matches, the packet is handled by the default policy (deny by default in most firewalls).

This ensures only legitimate, intended traffic is allowed, while blocking unauthorized or malicious connections.
